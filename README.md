# hidden-handle

## Project Overview:
What we offer is a new novel way of upgrading that door handle in an inconspicuous way that is non-existent in the current smart door handle market bloated with complicated and intimidating-looking mechanisms.Smart homes are a growing market with each and every section of a house incorporating technology to evolve, the same is true for handles be they on your door, your fridge, a school locker, a garage door, or an IIEC cabin space. What we offer is a new novel way of upgrading that door handle in an inconspicuous way that is non-existent in the current smart door handle market bloated with complicated and intimidating-looking mechanisms.

Our aim is to provide a commercial implementation of a door handle that at first glance appears to be perfectly rudimentary, one that might be encountered in a typical home. However, it actually houses a recognition mechanism that is able to identify an intruder anomaly in a fraction of a second and alert not only you, the owner but also all connected smart devices and your local smart home network.

We achieve this functionality by incorporating an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the underside of a traditional door handle. Due to this unique positioning, we lull any intruders into a false sense of security, inviting them to try to open the handle but as soon as they make this attempt our system recognises an anomaly as their handprints are not in the database and alerts the owner and all attached smart devices.

It is this unique selling feature of subverting expectations using smart construction on top of the addition of smart technology that would make us considerably more effective than our competition.
